This repo contains codes that are used to control the Gaucho Nacy Auto Robot(GNAR), which competes in the robot rodeo competition held by Fathomwerx Lab. The main objective is for the GNAR
to navigate through a course consisting of staircases, latches, and narrow paths, whether using joystick control or autonomously. The final goal of this competition is for the robot to be 
fully adapted to a navy ship environment, so it would be capable of accomplishing difficult/dangerous/time-consuming jobs for the Navies.
